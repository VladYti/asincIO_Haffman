Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level. If after the decrement it is zero, reset the lock 
to unlocked (not owned by any thread), and if any other threads are blocked waiting for the lock to 
become unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed. If after the decrement the recursion level is 
still nonzero, the lock remains locked and owned by the calling thread.
